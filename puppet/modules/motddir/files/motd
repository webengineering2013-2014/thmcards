Welcome to the THMcards - Virtual Machine.

You can start or stop the app from the /vagrant - directory with

forever <command> app.js

, where <command> is either start or stop.
You will have to wait for a few seconds until the app is launched.

The app can then be accessed through http://<server-ip>:3000 .
( Couchdb can be accessed through http://<host-server-ip>:5985 or
                                  http://<guest-server-ip>:5984.
  Jenkins can be accessed through http://<host-server-ip>:8091 or
                                  http://<guest-server-ip>:8090. )

Look at /vagrant/README.md for more details.

WARNING: 1.) The virtual machine's OS hasn't been upgraded since its creation.
             You can upgrade it like this:

             pacman -Syyu

             ( You may need to reboot the system after that. )

         2.) Take a look at /vagrant/WARNING.1 if you had provisioning
             problems with puppet and npm!
