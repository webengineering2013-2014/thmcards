The file CLOUDCONTROL.CREDENTIALS must be "next to" the file Vagrantfile and must consist of three lines,
containing your cloudcontrol.com-credentials:
<EMAIL>
<PASSWORD>
<APPNAME>
 
<APPNAME> will be created during puppet-provisioning and must not already exist!
It should contain only lowercase letters (and digits if necessary and must probably start with a letter as well).
Examine the output of Exec[configure-cctrl] during provisioning in order to make sure that the app has been created.

Furthermore a key will be uploaded to your Cloudcontrol-account via "cctrluser key.add" .
